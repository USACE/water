# Summary

Data models provide a conceptual, logical representation of real world concepts. They provide the foundation for data services and system interconnections. Foundational data models are shown below in the form of entity relationship diagrams. These models will grow and change to support additional requirements. We will aim to keep the data model documentation up to date.
